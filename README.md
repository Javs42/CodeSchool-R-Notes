#CodeSchool-R-Notes
==================

Personal notes for CodeSchool's elective on R. 

Elective can be found at http://tryr.codeschool.com

Notes are written in R with natural language prefaced with the # marker. Though you can run these files and its contents into an R terminal, many of the value functions and variables are missing or incomplete. 

Specifically, the first files' code lacks any real values and data for the variables and value functions. I abstracted as much as I could early on, though in the later chapters of the lesson (and subsequently the later files of this repo), I do not abstract and instead use my notes to breakdown, define, and explain what is happening in the code. 

The order of note files follows the the course and is deliminated by the number of the lesson. The first lesson's notes will be marked with "1" and the second with "2", so and so forth. 

Again, these are all notes and not actual code. Though code can be found within the notes, much of it is useless outside the context of the elective's lessons. This repo and the files within it serve as support and assistance to the actual lessons.
