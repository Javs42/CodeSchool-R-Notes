#Vectors


c(1,2,3)
	#1,2,3 can be any numbers or values of course


	#Vector w/ Strings
c('a','b','c')
	#Use single quotation marks to designate that each of the characters is in fact a string. Doesn't matter if it's single or double quotes, so long as you are consistent, though single helps avoid confusion when you actually need to use double quotes for words and sentences.


	#Sequence Vectors
	#Two ways to display sequence vectors
1. start:end
c(5:9)

2. sequence command
seq(5,9)

	#Sequence with increments
seq(5,9,.5)
	#The first two numbers represent the range and the last one represents the rate/scale of the increment.
